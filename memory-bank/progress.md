2025-04-13 12:50:15 - Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks
- Initial analysis of application structure
- Created containerization and CI/CD strategy
- Selected Docker Hub as container registry
- Created Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- Configured Nginx for SPA serving
- Created GitHub Actions workflow
- Configured security scanning with Trivy

## Current Status
Implementation Phase 1 & 2 completed:
- Dockerfile created with multi-stage build optimization
- Nginx configured with security headers and caching
- GitHub Actions workflow implemented with:
  * Docker layer caching
  * Security scanning
  * Automated builds and pushes
  * Version tagging

## Required Actions
Before the first deployment:
1. Set up Docker Hub secrets in GitHub repository:
   - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username
   - DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: Your Docker Hub access token (create at https://hub.docker.com/settings/security)

2. Test build process:
   ```bash
   # Local build test
   docker build -t standupnow .
   docker run -p 8080:80 standupnow
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Testing & Verification
   - Test local Docker build
   - Verify GitHub Actions workflow
   - Check security scanning results

2. Production Deployment
   - Monitor first automated build
   - Verify container registry pushes
   - Test deployed container

3. Documentation
   - Add deployment instructions
   - Document container usage
   - Update README.md
